Overall:
3.) Need to develop a way to fingerprint the router to see if we are compatible before 
    trying to authenticate/connect to it
4.) If we successfully fingerprint a router, we should probably have something to show 
    the user how to find the information we need, such as "Your router is X, you will 
    need to look at the sticker on the bottom" vs. "You have router Y, you will need to 
    look for the information card in the box with the router", etc.
5.) Need to dynamically choose port for python to run on. If port is hardcoded, there 
    is the potential that the server will not be able to start if the port is in use.
        - Spent about 6 hours working on this and made no progress. Ultimately rolled back changes
          and am proceeding with hard coded port for now.

2.) Need to implement a wait screen while app starts up (Mainly due to the delay in 
    python rpc starting)
1.) Make sure we can package selenium with the application
2.) Determine what browsers to support (The more I think about this, the more I am
    inclined to support the OS default browser: Mac = Safari, Win = Edge)
3.) An alternative to #2 would be to include a browser with the application
        - There might be a way to leverage the built in chromium engine in electron to
          accomplish this. Requires more research.
1.) Mac - When closing app, stays in dock and does not actually exit. (Not a bug, its a feature. lol)
1.) Implement back button on pages in case user misses something and needs to change it? - Andrew - DONE
2.) Need to theme wait screen (frontend/loading.html) - Andrew - DONE
1.) Bring up the user interface from Andrew into the new application format
